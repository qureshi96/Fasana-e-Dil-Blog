    I had been writing a blog on wordpress before by the name "Lazy Backpacker" where I wrote about my
    travel experiences. However, as the name suggests, I became a bit too lazy and stopped writing. I still have a lot
    of travel stories to share but now I want to write something more too.

    Hence, Fasana e Dil, which literally means stories of the heart. I know I might still be lazy to write with a
    constant frequency but I would try. I am moving away from wordpress and trying to put my mediocre skill of
    programming into some use by making this blog. The website is still too buggy but I will keep fixing and adding
    somethings with the time. This is the basic version I came up with. Any suggestions regarding the design and user
    experience are welcomed. I just hope that any recruiters don't find this terrible work! I am putting this web online 
    for some testing at the moment. Hopefully, a better version and blog posts are coming soon!
