        this.blogPost.content[0]= "'My passport is expiring in 5 months and 28 days', Asad wrote in whatsapp group 4 days before our flight to Amman. "+
        "Azeem, Asad and I had planned to get together, 7 years after high school. All of us could get visa on arrival in Jordan, so we chose Amman. Visiting Petra would have been a great bonus. "+
        "Everything would have gone according to the plan if we had planned to arrive a week earlier. Jordan requires minimum of 6 months passport validity at the time of arrival and Asad's passport missed out by a fine margin. "+
        "Hence, we had to call off the whole Jordan plan. But we were very determined to meet, so after a few hours of going through visa regulations and cheap flights, we came up with a new place, Tirana, and changed our tickets right away. "+
        "I have been interested in Balkans for a while now. Recently, Asad and I visited Serbia together which turned out to be a few eventful days. However, I knew Albania was going to be different.";
        this.blogPost.content[1]="Azeem and I were flying from London, Asad from Nuremburg. We were already in Albania as we boarded the plane, being the only non-Albanians in the flight. "+
        "Also the only ones not wearing either Gucci or Louis Vuitton. Azeem woke me up before landing to have a look outside. It was one of the most beautiful landscapes I have seen while landing. We flew above the Adriatic Sea, then took a turn over Durres towards Tirana. Greenry all around, surrounded by mountains with clouds floating at their peaks."+
        ". At the airport, again, everyone was wearing no less than a luxury Italian clothing brand. We kept wondering why are these people traveling on Wizz Air. It was only a few hours later, we found counterfeit brand shops all around the city center. Albanians don't wear anything that doesn't have a brand name printed on it, "+
        "big enough to be readable from a hundred metres away. People seem to be very brand conscious here and why not if you get them at a relatively much cheaper price. ";
        this.blogPost.content[2]="As soon we stepped out of the bus in city center, we almost got run over by a Mercedes S class on a Zebra cross. After being in western europe for some time, the awful traffic made us feel at home instantly. "+
        "There are mostly three types of vehicles on Albanian roads. Super expensive luxury cars, 2 seater smart cars, and motorbikes. The number of Mercedes seen every minute is very high. Albania has gone through a communist period in the past like its neighbours, but Tirana doesn't look anything close to Yugoslavic cities. "+
        "After the fall of communism, the government thought to change the communist look of the city which was rather grey. So, with little money, they decided to paint the old buildings with bright colors. I personally love the symmetry of brutalist architecture and I was looking forward to grey buildings with no balconies but they are now hard to find in Tirana."+
        " Nowadays there is a lot of modern high rise buildings being constructed in the city centre. ";
        this.blogPost.content[3]="While roaming in the streets, we came across a counterfeit shoes seller, Dorian, who gave us some inside information about why these shoes are three times cheaper. According to him, factory workers in Vietnam make shoes for adidas during their working hours and afterwards, they make the same shoes but they take them home and rather sell them in black market for a cheap price"+
        ". That's how everyone in Albania ends up wearing ultraboosts. Albania is also one of Europe's biggest drug suppliers which justifies the number of Mercedes G Wagons on the roads. Google doesn't know much about this country either. Some places are wrongly located on the maps and there are no realtime public transport routes on google maps either. So, for our time in Tirana, we just walked around aimlessly in the streets, occassionally sitting outside cafes."+
        " Instead of Starbucks, Costa and Cafe Nero, there are Mulliri, Mon Cheri and Sophie Cafe. Sophie became our favourite after trying all three. I would order a cup of tea whereas Asad and Azeem would always get caramel latte and we would listen to Azeem educating us about topics ranging from conspiracy theories to love life. That's mostly what we did in Tirana."+
        ""
        this.blogPost.content[4]="On the weekend, we decided to get out of Tirana. There were 4 places to choose from. Shkoder, Berat, Gjirokaster or Ohrid. We went to the intercity bus terminal and hopped in a 40 years old van and snaked through the Albanian countryside arriving in Berat a couple of hours later. First impressions were of an abandoned communist town. However, a couple of miles into the town centre, there was a complete change of scenes. A crystal clear river flows through the city with small ottoman houses on either sides. Green hills all around with ice capped mountains in the backdrop. We were instantly in love. Albania had been a part of Italian empire in the past and this town was a reflection of this fact. Old people wearing long coats drinking coffee in small cups in the streets with their Vespa parked alongside. Italian tv channels have been running on Albanian TVs for a long time. Hence, everyone speaks Italian as a second language. There is a castle atop the hill that has a few of Byzantine churches and Ottoman mosques. Our hotel's receptionist, Leila, was a sweet woman who despite knowing very little English, always tried to talk to us. We were the only people in the hotel and town was not crowded either. People were much more laid back than in Tirana. We stayed for a couple of days and didn't want to leave."
        this.blogPost.content[5]="As I write this now sitting in Tirana. It's been one week here in Albania. We've met some interesting characters during this time, ate some great food, learnt some cool facts, but the thing we have enjoyed the most is each other's company. Asad left this morning and we are leaving tomorrow. We have already start to miss these days. Albania might not be people's top travel destination but for me, it would remain special for the time we spent here. "
