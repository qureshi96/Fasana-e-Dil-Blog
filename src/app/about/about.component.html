   I am Usman, also currently being referred to as Uzzie by some people here in Edinburgh. 
   I would describe myself as an ambivert (introvert in most situations) and a professional procrastinator, 
   with 150% brain efficiency an hour before the deadline (too late!). 
   Growing up in a small town in Pakistan, I wanted to be an Archaeologist because it was the coolest word I read in the history book. However, I have ended up being quite the opposite, a struggling 
   Computer Scientist.

    I like to walk, sit in cafes, watch people, take symmetrical photos, and overthink. I have been living in different places during last 10 years.
    Each time I left a place, I left a part of me there and took a part of that place with me. My late maternal grandfather owned a bookshop in Multan. When
    I was about 11, he gave me a book that changed my life, 'Niklay Teri Talash Mein', Mustansar Hussain Tarrar's first travelogue.
