Although I still have problems with social integration, I have started to feel like a part of this place. This is a very pretty city. A walk around the town can make you feel better about your solitude. However, this place can also be heartbreaking and makes you feel lonely sometimes, happens with me specially on days when I see a lot of happy people and feel jealous of them. Before moving here, I was working in Lahore and was very excited about this new chapter. I thought that finally my life would change. I would be more social, meet a lot of people and learn a lot of new things. Now I look back at last few months, I guess my expectations were a little too high. I have not been more social than before. I have managed to make some Pakistani friends, which is quite easier because of the language. But now I keep telling myself to give it some more time. I will eventually meet more people.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[1] = \"One thing that I am loving about living here is the cafe culture. There are so many cozy and peaceful cafes around the town. Perfect for someone like me. Grab a kettle of peppermint tea, sit by the window, read a book or work on laptop, ocassionally look outside at the people passing by. We didn't have such places like that in Islamabad (except Loafology where I started going very late). However, the only complain I have about these cafes, is that they close very early. Usually around 5pm. So, in the evening there is nowhere to sit except the pubs. For someone who lived in Pakistan all his life, where going out for a cup of tea at midnight is a norm, it is a bit of a stretch of get used to such routine. But I am slowly getting there. Early to bed, early to rise. By the way, here is a picture of the place I have been calling home lately.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[2] = \"I don't miss Pakistan as a whole. I wanted to leave when I was there. Still, I am a nostalgic person. Nostalgia might not be termed as a psychological disorder yet, but it does affect us in many ways, sometimes good, sometimes bad. I was living away from my parents in Pakistan for many years and I thought it wouldn't make much of a difference whether I live in Islamabad or Edinburgh. But, I was wrong. I do miss some specific moments, people, places and food. Those things have become a part of me now, things that I can't change. I don't want to go back though.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[3] = \"Probably the biggest change in the past few months is that I have started playing cricket after 7 years. I feel like being in high school again. It feels like I had never stopped playing. My leg spin is still a bit dodgy but it does turn enough to beat the batter once in a while. Great feeling, that. I always considered myself a decent batsman but never got enough chance to bat in high school team (there were already too many better batters) but I have been batting quite well here. I feel I am gaining some respect from the guys at the cricket club. They recently started calling me Uzzie. It gives me a sense of accomplishment. We play twice a week during the term. Since, it's winter, we play indoors at the moment. I am really looking forward to the outdoor season.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[4] = \"There are some downsides of living in Edinburgh, like the mostly-rainy weather and very lazy public transport. The buses stop after every milimeter. Still, it is hard not to like this place. Beautiful old town built of stones, and smiling faces make up for it. My start in Edinburgh might have been a bit slower than I expected, but I have now started to get the hang of it. One day at a time.\";\n  }\n\n}","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
