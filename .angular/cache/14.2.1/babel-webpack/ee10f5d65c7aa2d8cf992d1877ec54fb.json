Match ended in a draw due to bad light with Pakistan at 302-9 with 4 overs remaining.\" + \" All three results were possible if the earth had stopped rotating for a few minutes. Nonetheless, a very entertaining game of cricket.\" + \" As I write this, I sit at a cafe in Marylebone, a stone's throw away from Lord's Cricket Ground, the Home of Cricket. So, I thought \" + \"what could be a better time and place to recall the memories related to cricket in my life.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[1] = \"Although I also follow Tennis and Football, Cricket would always hold the most special place in my heart, for two reasons. One, \" + \"because Pakistan has a decent national cricket team as compared to our representation in other sports. Two, I have been playing cricket since a very young age, or at least \" + \" have been shadow bowling. My earliest vague memory of watching cricket is Pakistan vs England Test Series in 2001. Inzi batted England out of the game in one of the matches.\" + \" Later in 2003 summer, along with my father and uncle, I went to the Edgbaston Stadium in Birmingham. It was the first day of the Test match between England and South Africa.\" + \" Herschelle Gibbs and Graeme Smith, both, scored 150+. It was a whole day of watching Flintoff and Anderson being smashed all around the ground. I vividly remember Gibbs hitting a cover drive and none of the fielders moved even a single step.\" + \" I was quite young at that time. Young enough to not understand LBW completely, but I enjoyed a lot. However, the series that made me fall in love with the sport, specifically Test Cricket, was the 2005 Ashes.\" + \" That 'Edgbaston Test'. Ponting batting all day in Manchester and then Brett Lee holding on for a draw. Flintoff scoring a ton to save the team. Shane Warne bowling his heart out for a losing cause. That series had everything.\" + \" And that was when I knew I wanted to bowl leg spin. Since then, I have been following Test Cricket no matter where I am or where the match is. \";\n    this.blogPost.content[2] = \"Talking about my memories of playing cricket, the earliest I remember was playing with my father in our patio upstairs at our home in Alipur. I would have been 5 or 6 years old.\" + \" A couple of years later, I started playing with other boys in Committee ground. That was a start of my so called cricket career. That was the time when I bought my first ever hardball bat, a replica Gunn & Moore from Dawn Sports Shop in Multan.\" + \" Every kid, who grows up playing cricket in Pakistan, wants to be a cricketer at some point. I was no different. In Committee ground, Cricket was not played for fun. Even though we were playing with tape balls, it was taken very seriously.\" + \" Losing team had to pay for the balls and tapes. We would analyse weaknesses of each bowler and batsman to make plans against them. Sledging was done professionally too. Every kid would mimic a specific international player and imagine himself playing in his favourite stadium.\" + \" All of the boys playing in Committee ground belonged to different socioeconomic backgrounds, but once on the field, all of them were heroes. The fastest bowlers and cleanest hitters were considered local celebrities and we were inspired by them. Committee ground was my theatre of dreams.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[3] = \"Anyone, who has played cricket at any level, would relate to the fact that all our innings can be classified into three types. The ones we don't want to forget, the ones we don't want to remember, and the ones that don't really matter. My most painful cricketing memory is Prep School Interhouse Final, 2010. \" + \"Alamgir South vs Alamgir North, the ultimate rivalry. I was playing for Alamgir South, as vice captain. Alamgir North batted first. I bowled very badly. I don't think I had bowled worse than that before (I managed to bowl worse afterwards). They scored 115 in 15 overs.\" + \" I decided to open the batting, for the first time ever. We got off to a slow start but kept catching up the required run rate after the powerplay\" + \". Wickets kept falling on the other end but then we made a good partnership at 5th wicket, Zafar Bugti and myself. Required rate came down to run a ball. We were rotating the strike quite well. It was 12th over, 95-5.\" + \" I tried to hit the ball through the cover but it went straight into the hands of short cover. There was no need of that shot. 2 more wickets fell in the next over and we ended up losing by 5 runs. A very hard to digest defeat, more so because of the way Alamgir North celebrated right in front of us. For a long time, I kept regretting playing that shot. I still do, but life goes on.\" + \" Another agonizing memory was being hit for three consecutive sixes by Abdul Rehman Achakzai in high school. But it could be worse. I wonder what went through Chris Broad's mind.\";\n    this.blogPost.content[4] = \"I have had my share of good moments on the field too. How can I forget my 3 wickets in 2 overs against an amateur team from Rahim Yar Khan.\" + \" A one handed catch at backward point against Mehmud House. It was a fluke, obviously, but that moment was overwhelming. Playing a cover drive to Rana Faisal's 100kph off spin and holding the pose till the ball went past the boundary.\" + \" My first competitive game here in Edinburgh, bowling the batsman out, stumped, in my first over. For a leg spinner, there is no better sight than the batsman playing the right line but the ball spinning past him. We often know if its going to beat the batsman right when the ball leaves our fingers. There is a satisfaction in putting maximum revs on the ball. Spinners would understand.\" + \" Cricket is a slow sport. So there is a lot of time to absorb the emotions it takes us through. In a Test match, you dominate one day, but its not the end. Next day tables can turn. Every day you get a chance to bounce back, to fight, to win. Cricket is just like Life.\";\n  }\n\n}","map":null,"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
